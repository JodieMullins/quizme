I created this document to record experience with the following question on the Week 6 Quiz:

After you initialize a new git repository and create a file named git-quiz.html, which of the following commands will not work if you run it?

## Why did I create this? 

There are two incorrect answers. One makes the most sense; the other is also correctly incorrect, but would be improper order of commands to transfer from local to remote repository. 

I decided to document both answers in immediate order for an idea of the truthfulness in two incorrect answers.
