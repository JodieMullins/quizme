I created this document to record experience with the following question on the Week 6 Quiz:

After you initialize a new git repository and create a file named git-quiz.html, which of the following commands will not work if you run it?

## Why did I create this? 

There are two incorrect answers. One makes the most sense; the other is also correctly incorrect, but would be improper order of commands to transfer from local to remote repository. 

I decided to document both answers in immediate order for an idea of the truthfulness in two incorrect answers.

Following proper git order of commands, there is an immediate first correct option to determine the command that will not work upon running in the command terminal. There is also a correct syntax option available that will not run immediately, but is also not in the immediate assumed order of operations given the question.
